1. The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was estalblishing causality between Sea surface temperatures
   and the populations of pacific sardine and northern anchovy
2. One potential investigation I would like to pursue in Quarter 2 is investigating causation between human industrial
   activity such as in factories or gas powered vehicles and air quality.
3. One potential change I would make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 project is to find better-sourced
   data. I feel that the data I am currently working with is unreliable so I have trouble trusting the results of my analysis.
4. One technique I would be interested in using in my project is predictive machine learning ai to predict whether future
   use of things such as gas powered cars will have much worse consequences in the near or far future.

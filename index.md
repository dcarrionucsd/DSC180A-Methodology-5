<strong>What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?</strong>
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was estalblishing causality between Sea surface temperatures
and the populations of pacific sardine and northern anchovy

<strong>Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.</strong>
One potential investigation I would like to pursue in Quarter 2 is investigating causation between human industrial
   activity such as in factories or gas powered vehicles and air quality.

<strong>What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?</strong>
One potential change I would make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 project is to find better-sourced
   data. I feel that the data I am currently working with is unreliable so I have trouble trusting the results of my analysis.

<strong>What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?</strong>
One technique I would be interested in using in my project is predictive machine learning ai to predict whether future
   use of things such as gas powered cars will have much worse consequences in the near or far future.
